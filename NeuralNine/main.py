SQLAlchemy ORM Tutorial - Complete School Management System

This module demonstrates a complete school management system using SQLAlchemy ORM.
It showcases relationships, CRUD operations, and real-world database patterns.

Key Concepts Covered:
- SQLAlchemy ORM vs Core
- Declarative base and model definitions
- One-to-Many relationships
- Many-to-Many relationships
- Association tables
- Session management
- CRUD operations
- Query examples
